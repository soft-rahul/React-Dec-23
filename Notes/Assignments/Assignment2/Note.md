# Difference between NPM & NPX

![Image](Screenshot%20(522).png)

NPM and NPX are both associated with the environment and make our work with Javascript packages easier. While NPM is used as a package manager, NPX, on the other hand, is used to execute Javascript packages. 

## What is NPM?
NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a Javascript package manager and the default package manager for Node projects. NPM is installed when NodeJS is installed on a machine. It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM. , and it hosts public and private 'packages.' To add or update packages, we use the NPM CLI to interact with this database. 

Isaac Z. Schlueter developed NPM purely in Javascript. It was first released in November 2010. Ever since, NPM has had a lot of updates and has improved in terms of efficiency, speed and security. 

## What is NPX?
NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.

<h6>
The primary use case of NPX  is when we need to use a particular package just once. In such cases, first installing it and then executing it becomes a very redundant task. This is why NPX is a powerful tool.

## What is a JavaScript module bundler?

A bundler is a **development tool** that combines many JavaScript code files into a single one that is **production-ready loadable** in the browser.


## What is the Difference Between dependencies and devDependencies

### Dependencies
Dependencies are packages that are required for your application to run properly. These packages are installed and loaded by default when you run your application. Dependencies are typically modules or libraries that provide the functionality to your application, such as UI frameworks, database connectors, or utility functions.

Dependencies are essential to the functionality of your application and should be included in your package.json file. When you run npm install or yarn install, all dependencies will be installed along with your project's other packages.

### DevDependencies
DevDependencies, on the other hand, are packages that are only required for development and testing purposes. These packages are not necessary for the functionality of your application and are not loaded when you run your application. DevDependencies typically include testing frameworks, build tools, and code quality checkers.

DevDependencies are not required for the end user of your application but are necessary for the development process. They should be installed separately from your dependencies using the --save-dev flag in npm or --dev flag in Yarn.
