# Difference between NPM & NPX

![Image](Screenshot%20(522).png)

NPM and NPX are both associated with the environment and make our work with Javascript packages easier. While NPM is used as a package manager, NPX, on the other hand, is used to execute Javascript packages. 

## What is NPM?
NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a Javascript package manager and the default package manager for Node projects. NPM is installed when NodeJS is installed on a machine. It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM. , and it hosts public and private 'packages.' To add or update packages, we use the NPM CLI to interact with this database. 

Isaac Z. Schlueter developed NPM purely in Javascript. It was first released in November 2010. Ever since, NPM has had a lot of updates and has improved in terms of efficiency, speed and security. 

## What is NPX?
NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.

The primary use case of NPX  is when we need to use a particular package just once. In such cases, first installing it and then executing it becomes a very redundant task. This is why NPX is a powerful tool.
